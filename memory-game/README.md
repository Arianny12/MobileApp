WEEK 4 HOMEWORK:

To-Do List App for Payment and Finance Management

User Story:  
As a person managing multiple bills, subscriptions, and financial obligations, I want a to-do list app that helps me track payment due dates, subscription renewals, and manage debt repayments, so that I can avoid missed payments, stay organized with my finances, and reduce financial stress.


Feature: 
Payment Due Date Tracker & Subscription Manager
The app should allow users to set reminders for recurring payments (such as utilities, rent, credit card bills, etc) and monitor their subscriptions (such as netflix, disney, etc). It should also allow users to manage payment methods and track debt repayments. This feature will help users avoid late fees, and monitor their recurring expenses.


Audience: 
- People who have multiple bills, loans, or recurring payments.
- People who work a lot of hours, who may find it hard to keep track of their finances.
- People with multiple subscriptions who want to manage renewals and cancellations.
- Anyone dealing with debt repayments, who needs a way to stay on top of payments and track their progress all in one space.
- Younger generation or recent graduates who are starting to manage their own finances.
