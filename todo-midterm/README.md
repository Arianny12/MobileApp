Homework #4
User Story:
As a person managing multiple bills, subscriptions, and financial obligations, I want a to-do list app that helps me track payment due dates, subscriptions, and debt repayments, so that I can avoid missed payments, stay organized with my finances, and reduce financial stress.

Feature: The app should allow users to create a list of things that they need to pay (such as utilities, rent, credit card bills, etc) and their subscriptions and debt repayments. This will help users avoid late fees, and check their recurring expenses.

Audience:
People who have multiple bills, loans, or recurring payments.
People who work a lot of hours, who may find it hard to keep track of their finances.
Anyone dealing with debt repayments, who needs a way to stay on top of payments and track their progress all in one space.
Younger generation or recent graduates who are starting to manage their own finances.
