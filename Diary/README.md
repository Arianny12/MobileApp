This is my final project for the Mobile Dev Class

This mobile app, A Girl’s Diaries, is a personal diary app designed for young women to have quick and easy access to their diaries and reflect on their day to day. In this app you can view the calendar to see different inspirational quotes based on the day. It’s the perfect diary for girls looking to write their journey while staying inspired and organized.
